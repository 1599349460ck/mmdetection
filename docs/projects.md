# Projects

Some papers published in top-tier conferences (CVPR, ICCV, and ECCV) implement their methods using MMDetection.
There are also some projects build upon MMDetection.
We list some of them as examples of how to extend MMDetection for your own projects.
Pull requests are also welcomed.

To make this list also a reference for the community to develop and compare new object detection algorithms, we list them following the time order of top-tier conferences.
Methods already supported and maintained by MMDetection are not listed.
