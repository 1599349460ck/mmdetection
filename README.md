Open-MMLab Detection Toolbox

**Note:** 

We are still working on organizing the codebase. This toolbox will be formally released by the end of September. Stay tuned!

---

## Major Features

- **Modular Design**

  One can easily construct a customized object detection framework by combining different components. 
  
- **Support of multiple frameworks out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular detection frameworks, *e.g.* Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN, and R-FCN, etc.
  
- **State of the art**

  This was the codebase of the *MMDet* team, who won the [COCO Detection 2018 competition](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-leaderboard).
