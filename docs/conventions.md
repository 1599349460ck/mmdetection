## Loss
In MMDetection, a `dict` containing losses and metrics will be returned by `model(**data)`.

For example, in bbox head,
```python
class BBoxHead(nn.Module):
    ...
    def loss(self,
             cls_score,
             bbox_pred,
             rois,
             labels,
             label_weights,
             bbox_targets,
             bbox_weights,
             reduction_override=None):
        losses = dict()
        if cls_score is not None:
            avg_factor = max(torch.sum(label_weights > 0).float().item(), 1.)
            if cls_score.numel() > 0:
                losses['loss_cls'] = self.loss_cls(
                    cls_score,
                    labels,
                    label_weights,
                    avg_factor=avg_factor,
                    reduction_override=reduction_override)
                losses['acc'] = accuracy(cls_score, labels)
        if bbox_pred is not None:
            bg_class_ind = self.num_classes
            # 0~self.num_classes-1 are FG, self.num_classes is BG
            pos_inds = (labels >= 0) & (labels < bg_class_ind)
            # do not perform bounding box regression for BG anymore.
            if pos_inds.any():
                if self.reg_decoded_bbox:
                    bbox_pred = self.bbox_coder.decode(rois[:, 1:], bbox_pred)
                if self.reg_class_agnostic:
                    pos_bbox_pred = bbox_pred.view(
                        bbox_pred.size(0), 4)[pos_inds.type(torch.bool)]
                else:
                    pos_bbox_pred = bbox_pred.view(
                        bbox_pred.size(0), -1,
                        4)[pos_inds.type(torch.bool),
                           labels[pos_inds.type(torch.bool)]]
                losses['loss_bbox'] = self.loss_bbox(
                    pos_bbox_pred,
                    bbox_targets[pos_inds.type(torch.bool)],
                    bbox_weights[pos_inds.type(torch.bool)],
                    avg_factor=bbox_targets.size(0),
                    reduction_override=reduction_override)
            else:
                losses['loss_bbox'] = bbox_pred.sum() * 0
        return losses
```
`bbox_head.loss()` will be called during model forward.
The returned dict contains `'loss_bbox'`, `'loss_cls'`, `'acc'` .
Only `'loss_bbox'`, `'loss_cls'` will be used during back propagation,
`'acc'` will only be used as a metric to monitor training process.

By default, only values whose keys contain `'loss'` will be back propagated.
This behavior could be changed by modifying `BaseDetector.train_step()`.
